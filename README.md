# eno

This is the initial language development repository for the *eno notation
language*.

**In the meantime almost all resources have migrated to [eno-lang.org](https://eno-lang.org) where they are available in a more accessible and interactive way (live document editor, live examples, etc.).**

You are still welcome to open an issue here in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/eno-lang/eno/issues) if you have questions or want to help.

What has not been migrated to eno-lang.org and is still maintained here:

- `DETAILS.md`, which contains a work in progress write-up of the more intricate
details of the eno language specification (those more relevant to implementing
than to using it).

- `rfcs-final-spec/` - The RFC documents for the final specification of eno.
