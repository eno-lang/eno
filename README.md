# Eno

This is the original language development repository for the eno notation language.

**Most resources originally developed here have now been migrated to the [guide](https://eno-lang.org/guide/) and [specification](https://eno-lang.org/specification/) on [eno-lang.org](https://eno-lang.org), where they are available in a more accessible and interactive way (live document editor, live examples, etc.).**

The one remaining thing still happening in this repository is the development and
publication of RFCs pertaining to the last remaining, not yet fully specified features of Eno (about 5%) - take a look at the `rfcs-final-spec/` directory for those.

Feel free to open an issue if you have a question, feedback on an RFC or want to help out with something.
