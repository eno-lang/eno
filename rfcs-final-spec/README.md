# RFCs for the last remaining unspecified bits

About 95% of Eno (including all fundamental characteristics of the language) have been stable for well over a year now.

This directory holds proposals for the last remaining, not fully specified 5% of the specification, authored in the form of RFCs (request for comments). You are welcome to comment on the proposals by opening an issue and referring to the rfc on which you would like to provide feedback.

The aim of these last RFCs is to eliminate design flaws and oversights, to fix ambiguities and propose changes only where they serve to make the language more readable, predictable and usable to the widest audience possible (as envisioned by the eno design philosophy and goals).
