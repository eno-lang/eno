# RFCs for the final eno specification

Eno's current specification is fully featured, but even so it constitutes a *release candidate* to be superseded by *one last and final* iteration to the specification (currently planned for Q2 2019).

This directory documents changes under consideration for this upcoming final specification in the form of RFCs (request for comments). You are welcome to comment on proposed changes by opening an issue and referring to the rfc on which you would like to provide feedback.

The aim of all proposed RFCs is to eliminate design flaws and oversights, to fix ambiguities and propose changes only where they serve to make the language more readable, predictable and usable to the widest audience possible (as envisioned by the eno design philosophy and goals).
